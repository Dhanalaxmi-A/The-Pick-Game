# The-Pig-Game

We actually have two players.So you can play this with a friend or something or just against yourself.So the idea is that we roll a dice.
And so now I'm playing number one.
So this one is now the active player.
So I roll a dice,
And so you see that I rolled a two.
And so this number gets added to my current score down here.
So this is my current score for the current round.
And this year is my total score.
And so let's see how that's going to work so I can roll the dice again now if I want to, and now I rolled a four and that four got added to the two that it had previously.
So now that's six and now I can choose to hold this score.
So if I click this button, this score of the current round will get added to my total score,which right now is zero.
And so when I hold a den, my score will be zero now.
And we switched to player number two,
and now I can click roll dice again.
So we rolled a two and I can hold again.
And so now play it two as two points.
Now, the thing here is that whenever we roll a one,
we lose all our current score
and it's then the next players turn.
And so that's why sometimes we need to hold or points.
So let me show that to you.
And indeed, I rolled a one right away.
And so now it's player two again.
So let's keep rolling the dice.
And I will now again, wait for one so that you can see that all my current score will be lost.
So that's a lot of points already there.
And now I rolled a one and a player lost all the points.
Okay. So I could have hold the points and then I would have added all these points here to my score.
So let's do that here and again, a one.
And so yeah, now here I hold and I edit them to these points.
And I think by now you get how the game works, right?
So the first player to reach 100 points then wins the game.
But I will now not demonstrate that because that's going to take too long.So we have these two buttons here,and then we also have just like in the previous game,a way of resetting the game.
So when I click here, as you might expect,this dice will disappear and all the scores are set back to zero.
